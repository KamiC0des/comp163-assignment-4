# WHAT THE GAME IS ABOUT

This is  text-based Python game where you take the role of a college student navigating through a semester. You start with stats like GPA study hours, soxial points, and stress level. 
Through a series of choices, you decided what course load to take (light, standard, or heavy) and what subject to study. These choices can affect your stats depending on your GPA, stress, and social points. 
Finally, you get a semester assessment that determines your performance based on your final stats.

# BRANCHING CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED

# STEP 2: 
I used if/elif/else statements and comparison operators (>, >=, <, <=, ==, !=) to check the users choice and GPA and adjust stress level and study hours, also to handle invalid inputs.
# STEP 3: 
I used if/elif/else statements and membership operators (in, not in) to validate correct subject inputs. Also, I used logical operators (and, or, not) to build conditions that affect the GPA and social points.
# STEP 4 (FINAL ASSESSMENT): 
I used if/else statements and identity operators for type checking (Ex. GPA is float, Study hours is in, etc.). I used nested if statements to check GPA, stress level, and social points to provide the student with their accumalted stats.
